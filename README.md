# VBA-Challenge
In this workbook, VBA scripting was used to analyze generated stock market data over four separate quarters.

## VBA Script
I Created a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:
*The ticker symbol
*Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end         of That quarter.
*The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the         end of that quarter.
*The total stock volume of the stock. 
*Add a functionality to the script in order to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest %          decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
